# A brief introduction of myself

I'm currently a graduate student major in Biostatistics at Columbia University. Before I came to New York, I spent four years in Maryland to finish my undergraduate courses at University of Maryland. I was double major in Mathematics and Economics because Iâ€™m interested in dealing with numbers and data. My future plan is to be a data analyst.

Here's a photo of me:
